\section{Professional \newline Experience}
\textbf{Children's Hospital Colorado} \hfill Aurora, Colorado\newline
\textit{Data Scientist Advanced} \hfill \textbf{November, 2019 - Present}\newline
As the senior data scientist in the Analytics Resource Center, I lead implementation of real-time machine-learning models into the electronic health record (EHR) providing clinical decision support. I provide expertise around software engineering and devops best practices, and leverage new technologies for clinical applications (e.g. LLMs).
    \begin{list2}
%     	\vspace*{-5mm}
      \item Designed and built a pipeline for custom model implementation into the production EHR to predict: risk of complications from influenza, risk of septic shock, and risk of serious bacterial infection, (Epic, Python, Docker, Azure)
      \item Replaced existing NLP process to analyize employee survey comments using ChatGPT (Azure OpenAI Service) in a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern (Azure AI Search), saving of 400 developer hours per year. (Python, Azure OpenAI Service, AI Search)
      \item Designed and built a process using a RAG pattern for ChatGPT to build patient cohorts using information contained in clinical notes, doubling the precision of existing NLP techniques. Eliminated 16 hours of manual chart-review time per 1000 patients.  (Python, Azure OpenAI Service, AI Search)
      \item Leveraged discrete event simulation with a hospital digital twin to build census projections used during the COVIDâ€‘19 reponse and ongoing strategic planning. (Python, FutureFlow RX)
      \item Developed a risk stratification model for a serious hospital acquired injury attaining 80\% recall with 75\% precision; results to be used for allocating scarce nursing resources. (Python, R)
      \item Supervised junior team members to design and develop models predicting the risk of central-line associated bloodstream infections, likelihood of employee turnover, and a time series model of respiratory-season hospital volumes using epidemiology data. (Data Robot)
      \item Co-author on clinical trial results for the sepsis models. Spoke nationally to audiences on real-time implementation and MLOps pipelines for custom models in Epic.
