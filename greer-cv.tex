\textit{Data Scientist Advanced} \hfill \textbf{November, 2019 - Present}\newline
As the senior data scientist in the Analytics Resource Center, I lead initiatives implementing real-time machine-learning models into the electronic health record for biomedical research and clinical decision support. I also provide expertise around software engineering and devops best practices, as well as piloting the use of new technologies for clinical applications (e.g. LLMs).
    \begin{list2}
%     	\vspace*{-5mm}
      \item Designed and built a pipeline for custom model implementation into the production Epic electronic health record to predict: risk of complications from influenza, risk of septic shock, and risk of serious bacterial infection.
      \item Co-author on clinical trial results for the sepsis models, speaking engagements to national audiences on implementation and MLOps pipelines for custom models.
      \item Hospital subject matter expert on scientific computing.
      \item Replaced existing NLP process to analyize employee sentiment results using ChatGPT (via the Azure OpenAI Service), realizing savings of 400 developer hours per year.
      \item Designed and built a process to use ChatGPT to build patient cohorts using information contained in natural language notes, doubling the precision of existing NLP techniques and realizing clinician savings of 16 hours per 1000 patients.
      \item Supervised junior team members to design and develop two models predicting the risk of hospital acquired conditions and a time series epidemiology model to predict respiratory-season hospital volumes.
