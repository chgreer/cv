\section{Professional \newline Experience}
\textbf{Children's Hospital Colorado} \hfill Aurora, Colorado\newline
\textit{Data Scientist Advanced} \hfill \textbf{November, 2019 - Present}\newline
I lead implementation of real-time machine-learning models into the production electronic health record (EHR) providing clinical decision support. I provide expertise around software engineering and devops best practices, and pilot new technologies for clinical applications.
    \begin{list2}
%     	\vspace*{-5mm}
      \item Designed and built a pipeline for model implementation in the production EHR to predict: risk of complications from influenza, risk of septic shock, and risk of serious bacterial infection, (Epic, Python, Podman)
      \item Designed and built a process using a RAG pattern with ChatGPT to cohort patient using information contained in clinical notes, doubling the precision of existing methods. Eliminated 16 hours of manual chart-review per 1000 patients. (Python, Azure OpenAI Service \& AI Search)
      \item Replaced existing process to analyize employee survey comments using ChatGPT in a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern, saving of 400 developer hours per year. (Python, Azure OpenAI Service \& AI Search)
      % \item Leveraged discrete event simulation with a hospital digital twin to build census projections used during the COVIDâ€‘19 reponse and ongoing strategic planning. (Python, FutureFlow RX)
      \item Developed a risk stratification model for a serious hospital-acquired injury attaining 80\% recall with 75\% precision; results to priorize valuable nursing resources. (Python, R)
      \item Supervised junior team members modeling the risk of hospital acquired injury, likelihood of employee turnover, and a time series of respiratory-season hospital volumes using epidemiology data. (Data Robot)
      \item Designed and built a planning process to allocate data science resources and provide visibility on committments to stakeholders.
      \item Co-author on clinical trial results for the sepsis models. Spoke nationally to audiences on real-time implementation and MLOps pipelines for real-time EHR models.

\textbf{Oracle} \hfill Broomfield, Colorado\newline
\textit{Principle Data Scientist} \hfill \textbf{February, 2017 - November, 2019}\newline
    \begin{list2}
    	\vspace*{-5mm}
      \item Incorporated geolocation data into the Oracle Data Cloud Identity Graph. (Python, Spark, AWS EMR, Docker)
    	\item Designed and built a privacy-preserving record linkage algorithm between incoming and fulfilled datasets, improving the quality of the match by 45\%, scale by 30\%, and standardizing the approach across 1000s of datasets. (Scala, Spark, EMR, Docker)
    	\item Designed and built a graph-quality measurement algorithm using a Monte-Carlo approach, demonstrating a factor of $\sim 6$ improvement over deterministic graph approaches. (Scala, Spark, EMR, Docker)
    \end{list2}
