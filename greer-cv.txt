Professional Experience

Children's Hospital Colorado
Aurora, Colorado
Data Scientist Advanced 
November 2019 -- Present

I lead implementation of real-time machine-learning models into the production electronic health record (EHR) providing clinical decision support. I develop new clinical models, provide software engineering and DevOps expertise, and pilot new technologies for clinical applications.

  -- Designed and built a pipeline for model implementation in the production EHR to predict: risk of complications from influenza, risk of septic shock, and risk of serious bacterial infection. (Epic, Python, Podman)
  -- Designed and built a process using a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pattern with ChatGPT to cohort patient using information contained in clinical notes, doubling the precision of existing methods. Eliminated 16 hours of manual chart-review per 1000 patients. (Python, Azure OpenAI Service \& AI Search)
  -- Replaced existing process to analyze employee survey comments using ChatGPT in a RAG pattern, saving of 400 developer hours per year. (Python, Azure OpenAI Service \& AI Search)
  -- Leveraged discrete event simulation with a hospital digital twin to build census projections used during the COVIDâ€‘19 reponse and ongoing strategic planning. (Python, FutureFlow RX)
  -- Developed a risk stratification model for a serious hospital-acquired injury attaining 80\% recall with 75\% precision; results to prioritize valuable nursing resources. (Python, R)
  -- Supervised junior team members modeling the risk of hospital acquired injury, likelihood of employee turnover, and a time series of respiratory-season hospital volumes using epidemiology data. (Data Robot)
  -- Designed a planning process to allocate resources and provide stakeholder visibility on commitments.
  -- Co-author on clinical trial results for the sepsis models. Spoke nationally to audiences on implementation and MLOps pipelines for real-time EHR models.


Oracle 
Broomfield, Colorado
Principle Data Scientist
February 2017 -- November 2019

  -- Incorporated geolocation data into the Oracle Identity Graph. (Python, Spark, AWS EMR, Docker)
  -- Designed and built a privacy-preserving record linkage algorithm between incoming and fulfilled datasets, improving the quality of the match by 45\%, scale by 30\%, and standardizing the approach across 1000s of datasets. (Scala, Spark, EMR, Docker)
  -- Designed and built a graph-quality measurement algorithm using a Monte-Carlo approach, demonstrating a $6\times$ improvement over deterministic graph approaches. (Scala, Spark, EMR, Docker)


KPMG
Denver, Colorado
Sr. Associate Data Scientist
October 2015 -- February 2017

  -- Designed and build a document classification tool for end-users. Created a domain-specific language for ease-of-use. (Apache OpenNLP, Spark, Python, Elasticsearch)
  -- Used the document classifier for information security and control for KPMG as well as data separation for large, multinational clients across millions of documents hundreds of TB in size.
